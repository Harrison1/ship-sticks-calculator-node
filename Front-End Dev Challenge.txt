Front-End Developer Challenge
---------------------------------

Directions: Build a calculator, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, that takes dimensional inputs and weight from the user and returns the product that matches our products in the DB. For simplicity sake, use the attached json file to manipulate results from a call to our product's API. The calculator, at minimum, should:

1) Live on a single HTML page with a link to "Launch Calculator'
2) Clicking "Launch Calculator" should open a modal with the calculator
3) Once the user inputs the dimensions and weight and clicks a "Calculate" button
    - The proper product name is shown in the modal "Use this Double Ski Bag" for instance
    - The modal then closes after 5 seconds
    - The product name is displayed on the original HTML page used to launch the calculator

---------------------------------

Helpful Hints:
-With shipping packages, you can always go bigger, but you can’t go smaller (i.e. if an item is 5”x5”x5", you will need the 6”x5”x6" package, not the 4”x5”x5” package). This is also the case for weight. In terms of interpreting the data, think of dimensions and weight of a product as MAX dimensions and MAX weight.
-The page should be visually appealing as the result of front-end development is consumer facing
-Please don't use any plugins unless they are a robust utility or framework (you're free to use jQuery, Twitter Bootstrap, etc.)

*Creative Bonus: Make it responsive and match (or improve) the branding on our current site
*JavaScript RockStar Bonus: Build a backend in Node.js so the calculator has an API to consume (i.e. a product data source)
